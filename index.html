                <p>Hello! My name is Ryleigh Rowell and I am from Lakeside, AZ. I enjoy reading, video games, and being outdoors. I am attending school for software development in hopes of learning what it is I want to do within the field. I work full time at a tech company in the sales department. The company allows their employees full access to the IT training videos, so I am excited to have another resource for learning more tech skills. I am the oldest of four girls and right below 2 step siblings, who each have two kids and I love spending time with my nieces and nephews. The gospel is the most important thing in my life. I served a mission in Jacksonville Florida and I try to keep that Spirit in my life each day.  </p>

            <p>Arizona is a state that consists mostly of desert, with a large Ponderosa forest up north. It borders Utah, New Mexico, Vegas, and California, with quick access to Mexico as well. The summers are scorching, but the winters are divine.</p>
