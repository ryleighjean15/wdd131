Healthy Living Hub

This site will have different pages with recipes, workout
routines, and mental wellness practices for those looking
to create a healthier lifestyle in all aspects. Included will be an
option to subscript to a weekly newsletter. I chose this topic 
because mental health is such a prevalent topic today and much of 
our mental state can be regulated with good practices including diet, 
exercise, and sensory regulation practices. I have found great joy in exploring
what works for me and sharing that relief with others around me. 

Scenarios: 
    -what are the healthiest foods containing all the 
    nutrients I need?
    -how can I create a structure to include
    therepuetic hobbies within my busy schedule?
    -quick and easy workouts to increase my 
    indurance and strength.
